                        Padmasree Warrior was born in the city of Vijayawada, India, a place far removed from the
                        bustling tech hubs of the world. However, her parents instilled in her a love for education and
                        a belief in the power of knowledge. This foundation led her to pursue a degree in chemical
                        engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, one of India’s most
                        prestigious institutions.

                        Warrior’s academic excellence and determination earned her a scholarship to Cornell University
                        in the United States, where she completed her Master’s degree in chemical engineering. Moving to
                        the U.S. was a transformative experience for Warrior, who was determined to make a mark in a
                        field where women, especially women of color, were vastly underrepresented.

                        Padmasree Warrior’s career began at Motorola in 1984, where she quickly established herself as a
                        force to be reckoned with. Her technical acumen, combined with her leadership skills, led to her
                        appointment as Motorola’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in 2003. In this role, she was
                        responsible for guiding the company’s technology strategy and innovation roadmap during a period
                        of significant change and competition in the telecommunications industry.

                        Warrior’s tenure at Motorola was marked by her ability to foresee and drive technological
                        trends. She played a pivotal role in the development of several breakthrough technologies,
                        including the Razr, which became one of the most iconic mobile phones of its time. Her work
                        earned her a place in Fortune’s list of the “50 Most Powerful Women in Business” multiple times,
                        solidifying her reputation as a leading figure in technology.

            Warrior’s approach to leadership is also deeply personal. She often speaks about the importance of work-life
            balance, a topic she has championed throughout her career. She has been candid about the challenges of
            juggling a demanding career with personal life, and her openness has made her a relatable and respected
            figure for many women striving to achieve their own balance.

                When Ginni Rometty stepped down as CEO of IBM in April 2020, she left behind a legacy of profound
                transformation and forward-looking innovation. Her leadership not only reshaped IBM into a modern
                technology
                company poised for future growth but also ensured that it remained relevant in an industry that is
                perpetually on the brink of the next big breakthrough. Rometty’s focus on AI, cloud computing, and
                quantum
                computing positioned IBM as a leader in these critical and emerging fields, setting the stage for the
                company to thrive in the decades to come. Beyond her accomplishments within IBM, Rometty’s impact on the
                broader technology industry and corporate world is equally significant. As a trailblazer for women in
                technology, she has been a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion, both within IBM and across the
                industry. She launched initiatives like IBM’s “P-TECH” (Pathways in Technology Early College High
                School)
                program, designed to create a pipeline of diverse talent in STEM fields, particularly among
                underrepresented
                groups. Her commitment to social responsibility and education has inspired countless women and
                minorities to
                pursue careers in technology, helping to create a more inclusive and equitable industry.

                that success is not just about what you achieve, but how you achieve it. Through her leadership, Warrior
