                        Mariam Nusrat’s rise to prominence is nothing short of extraordinary. Born in a small town, her
                        early life was marked by the same challenges many face—limited resources and a society that
                        often undervalued the potential of women. However, Mariam’s determination and passion for
                        learning were apparent from a young age. She excelled academically, driven by a vision of making
                        a difference in her community and beyond.

                        Her academic prowess earned her scholarships and opportunities that paved the way for her
                        further education. Mariam pursued her studies in fields that were traditionally male-dominated,
                        breaking barriers and proving that gender was no impediment to excellence. Her journey through
                        these challenging terrains laid the foundation for a career marked by innovation and impact.

                        Despite Rometty’s visionary approach, her tenure as CEO was not without its challenges and
                        criticisms. IBM’s
                        revenue continued to decline for several years, as the company struggled to transition away from
                        its legacy
                        businesses while simultaneously building new streams of revenue in emerging technologies.
                        Critics pointed to
                        these financial struggles as evidence that the transformation was not happening quickly enough
                        and
                        questioned whether IBM could regain its former glory. However, Rometty remained steadfast in her
                        belief that
                        the changes she was implementing would ultimately pay off in the long run. Her leadership style,
                        characterized by a focus on long-term results rather than short-term gains, was both praised for
                        its
                        foresight and criticized for its perceived slowness. Rometty often emphasized the importance of
                        continuous
                        learning and adaptation, both for herself and for the company. She was known for her hands-on
                        approach to
                        leadership and her willingness to make tough decisions, even when they were unpopular. This
                        included
                        significant workforce reductions and divestitures, which were necessary to streamline the
                        company and focus
                        on the strategic areas she believed would drive future growth. While some stakeholders were
                        frustrated by
                        the pace of change, others saw Rometty’s leadership as exactly what was needed to navigate IBM
                        through a
                        complex and rapidly changing technological landscape.

            <p>
                When Ginni Rometty stepped down as CEO of IBM in April 2020, she left behind a legacy of profound
                transformation and forward-looking innovation. Her leadership not only reshaped IBM into a modern
                technology
                company poised for future growth but also ensured that it remained relevant in an industry that is
                perpetually on the brink of the next big breakthrough. Rometty’s focus on AI, cloud computing, and
                quantum
                computing positioned IBM as a leader in these critical and emerging fields, setting the stage for the
                company to thrive in the decades to come. Beyond her accomplishments within IBM, Rometty’s impact on the
                broader technology industry and corporate world is equally significant. As a trailblazer for women in
                technology, she has been a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion, both within IBM and across the
                industry. She launched initiatives like IBM’s “P-TECH” (Pathways in Technology Early College High
                School)
                program, designed to create a pipeline of diverse talent in STEM fields, particularly among
                underrepresented
                groups. Her commitment to social responsibility and education has inspired countless women and
                minorities to
                pursue careers in technology, helping to create a more inclusive and equitable industry.
