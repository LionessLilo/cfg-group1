        <h1 class="main-heading">Corinne Vigreux: <br> Championing Women in Tech</h1>

        <img src="/Images/Corinne-Vigreux-header-image.gif" class="header-img">

        <p class="article-paragraph">
            In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, few names resonate as strongly as Corinne Vigreux. As a
            co-founder of TomTom, the pioneering location technology company, Corinne has been at the forefront of
            innovation, shaping how millions of people navigate their world. However, her influence extends far beyond
            the realm of GPS devices and digital mapping. Corinne's journey is not just a story of business success but
            a testament to the power of perseverance, vision, and a deep-seated commitment to driving meaningful change.
            Born in Lyon, France, Corinne's early years were marked by a curiosity about the world and a passion for
            learning that would eventually lead her to the prestigious ESSEC Business School. Her early career choices
            reflected a blend of entrepreneurial spirit and a keen interest in technology, a combination that would
            become the foundation of her future endeavors. When she co-founded TomTom in 1991, the company started
            modestly, focusing on software for handheld devices. Yet, under Corinne's leadership and with her strategic
            foresight, TomTom rapidly evolved into a global leader in GPS navigation systems. This transformation was
            not just about capitalizing on emerging technologies but understanding and anticipating the needs of
            consumers in a rapidly changing digital landscape. Corinne’s role in this success cannot be overstated. She
            was not just a leader but a visionary who recognized early on that technology should serve the people. Her
            work at TomTom exemplifies how technological innovation, when guided by a clear purpose and a deep
            understanding of consumer behavior, can lead to products that revolutionize industries and enhance everyday
            life.

                    <p class="article-paragraph">
                        Beyond her impressive professional achievements, Corinne Vigreux has become a passionate and
                        vocal advocate
                        for gender diversity in the tech industry, a cause that is close to her heart. In an industry
                        historically
                        dominated by men, Corinne has consistently championed the need for more women to take up space
                        in the tech
                        world. Her advocacy is rooted in a firm belief that diverse teams are not just beneficial but
                        essential for
                        driving innovation and solving complex problems. Corinne understands that when women are
                        underrepresented in
                        technology, the industry as a whole suffers from a lack of perspective, creativity, and
                        potential. This
                        understanding has driven her to not only speak out about the importance of gender diversity but
                        to take
                        concrete actions to promote it. One of her most significant contributions in this area is the
                        co-founding of
                        CODAM, a non-profit coding academy in Amsterdam launched in 2015. Inspired by the French school
                        Ecole 42,
                        CODAM is unique in its approach to education. It offers a high-quality, tuition-free education
                        in coding and
                        software engineering, making it accessible to students from all backgrounds, with a strong
                        emphasis on
                        supporting women and other underrepresented groups in tech. Through CODAM, Corinne aims to break
                        down the
                        barriers that prevent women from entering and excelling in the tech industry, providing them
                        with the skills
                        and confidence they need to succeed. The impact of CODAM is already being felt, as it produces
                        graduates who
                        are not only highly skilled but also deeply aware of the importance of diversity and inclusion
                        in the
                        workplace.

            Corinne Vigreux's influence extends far beyond the initiatives she has founded or the speeches she gives at
            conferences. She embodies the principles she advocates for, leading by example in every aspect of her life.
            As a leader, she has always prioritized creating inclusive environments where everyone, regardless of
            gender, can thrive. Her approach to leadership is characterized by a hands-on attitude, whether she is
            mentoring young women who aspire to careers in technology or working to ensure that TomTom remains a company
            where diversity is celebrated and promoted. Under her guidance, TomTom has implemented comprehensive
            diversity and inclusion programs aimed at ensuring women are well-represented across all levels of the
            organization. From entry-level positions to executive roles, Corinne has made it a priority to support the
            growth and development of female employees. She understands that for real change to happen, it must be
            embedded in the culture of the company, and she has worked tirelessly to make that a reality at TomTom. Her
            efforts have not gone unnoticed, and she is widely regarded as one of the most influential advocates for
            women in tech today. But for Corinne, this work is far from over. She continues to push for greater
            representation and equality in the tech industry, believing that the work of creating a truly inclusive
            industry is ongoing and requires constant effort and dedication.
        </p>
        <p class="final-paragraph article-paragraph">
            Looking ahead, Corinne Vigreux's vision for the tech industry is one where women are not just participants
            but leaders, innovators, and changemakers. She envisions a future where the tech industry reflects the
            diversity of the world it serves, and where gender is no longer a barrier to success but a source of
            strength and inspiration. Her passion for this cause is evident in everything she does, from her work at
            CODAM to her ongoing efforts to promote diversity and inclusion at TomTom and beyond. Corinne is driven by
            the belief that the tech industry, like any other, benefits immensely from the inclusion of diverse voices.
            She sees the potential for women to contribute in ways that will not only enhance the industry but also lead
            to more innovative and effective solutions to the challenges we face as a society. Through her tireless
            efforts, Corinne is helping to build a world where gender equity in tech is not just an aspiration but a
            reality. For women aspiring to make their mark in the technology sector, Corinne Vigreux is more than just a
            role model; she is a beacon of what is possible when passion meets purpose. Her legacy will not only be
            found in the groundbreaking products she has helped create but also in the lives she has touched, the doors
            she has opened, and the paths she has paved for future generations of women in tech.
